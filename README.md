Todo List Application
This is a simple todo list application that allows you to add and manage tasks. You can create a list of tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them as needed.

Usage
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
You will see a heading "Todo List" and an input field with a placeholder text "Add new item".
To add a new item to the list, type the task in the input field and click the "Add" button or press Enter.
The task will be added to the list as a todo item with a checkbox, the task label, and a "Delete" button.
To mark a task as complete, check the corresponding checkbox.
To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to it.
To view all the tasks in the list, click the "View All" button. A popup will display all the tasks in a bullet list format.
The application is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes. On mobile devices, the layout will adjust to ensure optimal usability.
Customization
You can customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the included CSS file (style.css).

Changing Colors
To change the background color of the todo list application, modify the background-color property in the CSS file. For example:
html, body {
  background-color: #f0f5f9;
}
You can replace #f0f5f9 with the desired color code.

Adjusting Styles
The application's styles are defined in the CSS file. You can modify various styles such as font, margin, padding, and more. Refer to the comments in the CSS file for specific sections that you may want to customize.
